# 🌊 WaterWatch Suite

WaterWatch Suite is an intelligent water security platform designed to shift utility management from reactive repairs to proactive, predictive maintenance. It combines simulated satellite imagery, real-time IoT telemetry, and offline-first community reporting to monitor aquifer health and critical infrastructure.

## 🚀 Features

- **Predictive AI Dashboard**
  - Forecasts hardware failures up to 48 hours in advance using vibration signature analysis.
- **Live Digital Twin Monitoring**
  - Real-time visualization of assets with flow rate, vibration, and battery metrics.
- **Offline-Ready Community Reporting**
  - PWA-enabled reporting for low-bandwidth and disconnected regions.
- **Sustainability Impact Tracker**
  - Measures ROI, water conserved (liters), economic savings, and social impact.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS  
- **Visualization:** Chart.js, HTML5 Canvas (Custom Map Engine)  
- **Design System:** Fluent Design aesthetics, Phosphor Icons  
- **Architecture:** Single-file SPA (Simulated Azure IoT Hub & Cosmos DB backend)

## 📊 Use Cases

- Early detection of pipeline and pump failures  
- Aquifer health monitoring  
- Community-driven infrastructure issue reporting  
- Sustainability and ESG impact assessment  

## 🧪 Simulation Note

This project simulates Azure IoT Hub and Cosmos DB behavior for demonstration and prototyping purposes.
